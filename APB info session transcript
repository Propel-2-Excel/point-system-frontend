Hello, everyone! Welcome!
I see… Everyone joining?
Feel free to drop in the chat where you're tuning in from.
Hi, everyone.
Lots of places.
Okay, we have lots to cover today.
So I'll just wait a little bit longer, and then jump right in.
Great.
Okay, so this session will be recorded.
So we're gonna jump right in. If anyone happens to miss anything, we'll be sending out a recording in a few days.
Hello, everyone. My name is Alyssa Tilden, and I am a senior recruiter here at LinkedIn, and I am one of four recruiters that you might speak with through the application process for our new Associate Product Builder program.
And I am so excited to welcome everyone here today. Thanks so much for joining from so many different places.
Now, to get started, so here at LinkedIn, we believe the most impactful work that you can do is to build products that matter. Products that solve real problems and make a difference in people's lives.
At the same time, change is happening faster than ever, and we believe that the builders who lean into new ways of working are the ones who will shape what comes next.
And so that's the spirit behind the Associate Product Builder Program, referred to as APB for much of this presentation, and why we are so super excited to introduce it to all of you today.
So why are we here? This session is about giving you a clear picture of the APB program, what it is, what we're looking for in builders, and how you can stand out in the application. You'll also get to meet some amazing people from our product team.
So let's dive in. Here's the agenda, and here's what we'll cover. First, why product builders? We'll talk about why LinkedIn is moving towards full-stack building, and why this moment matters.
Next, the program itself. How it's structured, what makes it unique, and what you can expect as an APB.
Then we'll go through the recruitment process, how you can stand out, and what the application actually looks like.
Then finally, we'll wrap up with a live Q&A with members of our product team who are spearheading the rollout of this program.
By the end of the session, our goal is simple. You'll walk away with a clear sense of what APB is all about, whether it's the right fit for you, and how you can put your best foot forward in the application.
So, why product builders? Let's start with hearing from our Chief Product Officer, Tomer Cohen, before I pass the mic to Melanie from our product team.
The future belongs to builders, and if you're entering the workforce today, you're part of this first AI-native generation.
At LinkedIn, we're launching something new. It's designed for those who want to shape the future of work and not just watch it unfold. This is the Associate Product Builder Program, a two-year rotational experience for early and career talent to learn the full-stack craft of building products in the AI era. This is not about writing docs.
You'll build and own end-to-end experiences, from idea all the way to launch.
speccing, designing, prototyping to shipping, this is about more than product building. It's a mindset. We're transforming how products are built, and you will play a key part in that. This is more than a job. It's a launchpad for the next generation of product leaders, those who think and build with an AI-first mindset, and lead with purpose.
Ready to build what's next? Join us, learn the craft, and lead with AI.

Awesome! Thank you, Elisa, and thanks, Tomer, for this video. Hi everyone, I'm Melanie, I'm a Senior Product Manager on our Enterprise Jobs team, which is our Talent Solutions team here at LinkedIn. And for this program, I also serve as our leadership and development lead, so making sure our APBs are supported with their development and everything that they will learn through this amazing program.
So, you've heard from Tomer, the best future product leaders will be the one who start learning full-stack building, from the get-go. And if we could move on two slides from here…
Awesome, thank you. So why builders, and why now? AI really redefines what's possible. Today, when you're in a product organization, you can… if you're a PM, you're gonna start discovery, talking to your customer, understanding their problems, and then you move on to, like, writing PRDs.
And then you have to translate those, with your designer. So you work with another person, and you go back and forth, back and forth, on how do we turn those requirements into prototypes and actual designs.
And then we move on further into the funnel, and I have discussion and back and forth, and I have to translate those requirements again to my engineering team, so they're able to build.
But now we have AI, and AI can really simplify this process and help us go much faster from discovery to code, and testing those experiments directly with customers, much more smoothly.
And also, at the same time, I spend so much time convincing cross-functional partners that this is the right thing to build, and the only thing I have today to do that is a PRD, so, like, a document.
It would be so much better, if I could actually have a prototype, and AI can really help me also there create prototypes right away and convince my cross-functional partner much faster.
And you, like all the people on this call, you're really this generation ready to lead. We're seeing the fluency when it comes to AI. We're seeing in the feed all those amazing products and all those tools that you're trying, that you're testing, and building things end-to-end, from the problem to actually having something to show for it.
And really, with APB, this is the launch pad. If you're a builder, if you've tried all of these, you don't even have to choose anymore. Today, you had to choose, like, do I want to be a product manager? Do I want to be a designer? Do I want to be an engineer? You don't have to choose, you can really…
harness AI and do all things together, and actually help us create the future of the product from the get-go.
So, super excited about this new program, but how would it look, in reality? So, if we go to the next slide, this will be a two-year rotational program, as Tomer mentioned, so you will spend one year into one team, and then, one year into a second team, so you will have access to different parts of the business.
learning to work with different folks, learning to work on different problems, which also broadens your skill set as a product builder overall. And we're not throwing you directly in a team and be like, hey, build something by tomorrow. This will start with a 30-day onboarding. So, really, when onboarding, you will learn what is LinkedIn, what it is to build
product at LinkedIn, like, all the steps of the funnels.
the tools that we use, and how mentors will also be able to be there in your journey to help you learn and execute on all those crafts. And then when you're finished onboarding, you'll be placed in a small AI native squad, so that will be you and APB and two, three engineers that will be there to help you build and ship products, and so you will really own
everything. So we will come from making sure we still understand our customer problems.
Defining ideas, and then working on prototypes, working with cross-functional partner, on those solutions.
And then really getting to ship product. The idea is that, at the end, you do have UI code that is shippable for the product and the customer problem that you've identified.
And all along all of this, you'll have mentorship, so you will have mentor inside your team, so a mentor that is also well-versed with the area and the problem area that you're working with, but you'll also have craft-specific mentors, so mentors more attuned with design, engineering, product, that will help you hone your craft in those specific disciplines.
as well, to make you a full, rounded product builder.
And then, visibility. This is super exciting, the visibility that this program is going to get inside LinkedIn. We are going through this full-stack builder change with this program at our root, and so, really, you'll have the visibility of being here to show the rest of the organization what it means to be a full-stack builder, and really be able to
Showcase to leadership, to other product managers, to other designer engineers, how it can be done internally.
So overall, very supported cohort, and we're super excited, to welcome you in January. And Elisa, I'll pass it to you for how to stand out.

Thanks so much, Melanie.
So yes, so now let's get into the recruitment process. Specifically, how do you get hired? So we'll start with what the ideal candidate profile looks like.
When we thought about what… like, when we thought about the kind of builder who would really thrive in this program, we focused on three things. So, the first being mindset, second being skills, and third, track record.
So, mindset. So, we're looking for people with high agency, people who don't wait for the perfect instructions, but instead take initiative, experiment, and figure things out. People who are driven to execute, make an impact, and push the boundaries of what is possible.
When it comes to skills, we want builders, as Melanie talked about, who can move across product design and engineering with AI as a natural part of how they work.
This program is about full-stack building, so we expect our future APBs to be able to take an idea end-to-end from problem to prototype to solution.
Lastly, we do want to see a track record.
We care less about a traditional resume or experience and more about what you've actually built. So what matters is that you've taken an idea and turned it into something real that people can use.
So those are the traits, now how can you stand out?
So there are a few key things that we think about that will make a candidate, like, shine.
The first is to show real impact. When we talk about sharing what you've built, don't just describe the features that you built, show us the problem that you solved, how people actually use it, and the outcomes. So even small-scale outcome… sorry, even small-scale impact will count.
Second is to demonstrate that full-stack thinking.
I know I talked about it in the last slide, but we do want to see that fluency across product design and tech.
Talk us through how you made decisions, trade-offs, and show us how you've adapted along the way.
Third is clarity and craft. Whether it's design polish, usability, or code quality, clarity does matter. So, keep your storytelling tight and communicate your ideas simply.
Lastly, we are looking for people who dream big. We want builders who will shape what comes next. So, show us your boldest ideas and how you imagine pushing the boundaries.
Now, the last thing I'll talk about before we jump into the Q&A is the application process. So, as I've mentioned, instead of focusing on resumes, we do want to see what you've built and why.
We'll ask you to create, sorry, we'll ask you to share a short video demo of a software product that you've created, something real that people have used or engaged with. You'll have the option to include supporting links or portfolios.
And then you'll answer a few questions about what you built, why you built it, and how you used AI tools along the way.
We'll be reviewing every application, so you won't hear from us until the end of September if you're chosen to move forward.
Here, you'll see the timeline, which I'll just quickly walk through.
The applications will open next Tuesday, September 2nd, and close on the 7th. So, it is a pretty short window. Be ready.
As I mentioned, recruiter phone screens will start towards the end of September, and then there will be two rounds of interviews.
We anticipate offers to go out in November, giving candidates clarity well before the holidays. And then finally, the program will kick off in January, where 10 associate product builders will start our first cohort.
And with that, I am very happy to have our panelists join the stage. We do… it is possible that the Q&A might go a little bit past the 30-minute mark, so please drop if you need. As a reminder, this is being recorded, so we'll be sending out that recording in a few days.
Melanie Coissard

Awesome! Let's kick off this Q&A, and this will be a question for Praveen. So, Praveen, I'll ask you to quickly introduce yourself, and then answer the question. And the question is, who is the APB program designed for, and what kinds of backgrounds or experiences make someone a really strong candidate for you?
Praveen Gujar
Praveen Gujar
14:36
Great, thanks, Melanie. Hey everyone, my name is Praveen, and I'm one of the product leaders here in LinkedIn. I specifically work in the LinkedIn Marketing Solutions business unit.
To, to the first question on who is this designed for, I think, we briefly touched upon this in the preamble. It's primarily designed for, career starters, someone who's basically either graduating or in the very early stages of, their career.
And, the second part of the question on, who's, the ideal candidate? An ideal candidate, for all the, in addition to everything that has been already described.
It's someone who basically has a blend of, product sense, design sense, and also some technical capabilities, who can get their hand dirty.
And transform from, a brainstorming and IDI into a shippable product, in, by closely working with a small group of, highly talented individuals. Those are the kind of a candidate and the ideal candidate we are looking for.
Melanie Coissard
Melanie Coissard
15:44
Awesome. Thank you, Praveen. So, we've talked about the demo, so how should candidates really think about tackling the demo, and what signals are you gonna look for that really make someone stand out? And Mel, I'll let you take this one first, and then pass it on to Nitin.
Mel Yencken
Mel Yencken
16:04
Hey everyone, I'm Mel, I'm Senior Director for Design for Growth and Premium, and representing design in this effort. Super excited. So, I'll give a very design-focused lens. So I think really start with the user. So, what problem were you solving? Why did it matter?
And then show how you worked across the different functions, so really highlight where you applied product thinking, your design choices, and your technical skills in the process, and then really clarify the impact. So be specific about how your product made the experience better, what need or problem did it really solve, and how did you measure that?
And showing those three, I think, will give us a really good understanding of your potential for this.
Nitin Julka
Nitin Julka
16:52
Yeah, I think, I fully agree. My name is Nathan, and I'm the executive sponsor of the APB program.
And I think, to the previous question also that Praveen answered, who we're looking for, we definitely think of this as an entry-level role, but any… anyone can apply to it, so it doesn't have to be early careers. I just want to clarify that. It's… it's more…
any builder who thinks that they could, you know, qualify and build. And in terms of the demo, I think everything Melanie said.
resonates. I… the only thing I would really say is show the experience of something that you have built.
that has real impact and real usage. So we… we want to see your demonstrated impact and the actual software products that you've built in a one-minute demo, and not…
you know, necessarily just, like, in theory, or this is the idea. We want to see you actually building in the real world, and showing, kind of, your role and the impact that you've driven.
Melanie Coissard
Melanie Coissard
17:58
Amazing.
Pravin, I'll go back to you. For candidates who may be stronger in one area, I'm seeing questions come into that theme in the chat as well. Say I'm stronger in design, or I'm stronger in engineering. How would I really think about showing the range of skills that I have across product, design, and technical skills in this application? So.
Praveen, I'll let you go first, and then pass on to Mel.
Praveen Gujar
Praveen Gujar
18:25
Yeah, I think that's a great question. We all have our strengths and areas of focus, too. I think my recommendation on this one would be to emphasize on the fact, like, on the, the strengths that you basically clearly demonstrate, let that shine up in the demo and the application process, but at the same time, in the areas that you realize that you need to.
develop on, focus on what you're doing specifically, to improve on these areas as well, and what does the trajectory would look like. That'll also help us better understand
where you stand from a full-stack builder perspective? At the same time, what are the gaps you're trying to cover in short-term to long-term as well?
Back to you, Melanie.
Mel Yencken
Mel Yencken
19:12
Great.
So yes, echoing what Ravine said, so lead with your strength, but then don't stop there, so show how you have the potential to stretch into other areas, and where you've been doing that, either in your explorations or in your early building. So.
If you're a designer, then maybe you can connect your work to technical feasibility and, you know, how you influence the product, definition and what the product outcomes were. If you're an engineer, show how you considered usability in the user journey.
I think you can demonstrate this adaptability, even if it's small efforts, like, where you were able to stretch into design with a sketch, with the user flow, or, you know, showing that product rationale.
But really show how you can think across product design and engineering.
And if design isn't your, like, area that you're as confident in, like, something that is probably one of the hardest things to teach for design is taste, and, like, what your personal level is for how you hold a bar for high-quality craft.
in design. And so that can be another thing that you can help us show, which is how, you know, you are…
Having a strong design taste in the work that you're putting together around your product, even how you're presenting your work, that will kind of come through.
Melanie Coissard
Melanie Coissard
20:35
Awesome.
Nitin, back to you. What does success look like for an APB at LinkedIn?
Nitin Julka
Nitin Julka
20:43
Totally. … … The first thing that comes to mind is impact, impact, impact. It is so important.
But for the APB role in particular, Melanie, I think as you were sharing, and as Alyssa was sharing in the beginning, like, the world is changing, and we're…
evolving into a more, kind of, AI-native way of building and running companies and society as a whole, and so…
how do we bring in the entry-level talent that's gonna help accelerate our transformation into an AI-native organization? So, how can we bring in the talent who's gonna push us, who's gonna work in a different way, and to help us grow and learn as an organization? We think of this role as representing the future of
product building at LinkedIn, and we're gonna be kind of co-designing and co… you know, what that role and what that future looks like. We have strong opinions.
And so if you are willing to come in, be very hungry, growth mindset, learn a lot, focus on impact.
And deliver the full end-to-end cycle from, like, the initial insight, the initial idea, all the way into prototyping, launch, and delivering real impact for real users.
You would be a great fit for this program.
Melanie Coissard
Melanie Coissard
22:13
Love it. …
And we'll take this question, this is a question for all of us, including me. So, what are we the most excited about, when it comes to this APB program? And I can kick us off. I'm just super excited to see
what the APVs are gonna ship, like, at the end of the day, the impact they're gonna make, and seeing their product or their new features, live, and to customers. I was an APM 6 years ago, and I know just how incredible it is to
ship your first feature inside a big organization like ours, and so I'm just so excited to see APBs do that end-to-end so quickly.
And to Mel, what are you excited about?
Mel Yencken
Mel Yencken
23:04
I'm really excited because we're kind of on the cutting edge of defining this new role as a product builder, and so this first cohort who's going to be joining us is going to help us shape this builder culture.
Where we create this environment where user empathy, craft, technical innovation, you know, utilizing AI to change how we build, kind of come together to make these amazing products where we can move really quickly and iterate quickly based on what we see.
And I'm always so inspired by our early career professionals who've come in in our previous programs. They just often look at problems in very surprising ways, or see new possibilities for users. And so I think with this future cohort that we're gonna be bringing in, there's so much opportunity there.
I'll pass to… Praveen.
Praveen Gujar
Praveen Gujar
23:54
Right, I think I'll build upon Mel here. Being associated with the Associated Program… Product Manager program as well, and what I… I'm really excited with this is…
the creativity, or the freshness that, that, individuals like you bring in, to, LinkedIn and to the program itself.
I think it gives us a better way, or a different way of thinking. And with the APB program, we are broadening who do we intake into this program, so I think we expect a lot more
diversified thinking, and also creativity that gets along with it. So, really excited about that. I think this is one cohort that I always look forward in a year. I'm super excited about that.
Nitin Julka
Nitin Julka
24:43
For me, …
I've been running the APM program for 4 plus years, and now the executive sponsor of the APB program, and we've had this principle that we want to bring in talent that will disrupt how we are thinking about the program.
And I feel like with everything going on in the world today, this is, like, a unique opportunity to really disrupt how we're building, how we're working, how we're doing things, bring in, you know, unique talent, interdisciplinary talent that can really blend across roles and drive
High velocity, high impact, high iteration.
And, I really think that we're defining the future of how we build and bringing in this incredible entrepreneurial, you know, talent that will drive massive impact for our organization, and I could not be more excited.
Melanie Coissard
Melanie Coissard
25:38
As you can tell, we're all very excited. I finished running through the list of questions that you had pre-shared with us pre to this meeting, so I'm gonna move on to a couple of questions that we are seeing in the Q&A here that seem to be really top of mind for all of you. I'll start with, is it okay if not many people use the product I build? Will it hurt our chances if adoption
It's a bit low for the product we've built.
Nitin, do you want to take that one?
Nitin Julka
Nitin Julka
26:08
So, we understand that this is an associate-level role.
So, when I…
love impact, but, you know, we're not expecting you, the founder of Salesforce or something, to be applying to this program. Like, it is an associate-level role, but we do want to see…
demonstrated impact that would be expected at, like, a level for this role. So we don't want to see, you know, a non-functional prototype with no usage. Like, if that's what you're planning, like, I wouldn't… I wouldn't think that that's a…
the ideal fit, but if you have something that you've built, if you're a builder, and you have demonstrated impact at your level that would be expected for an associate-level role, then I would say please do submit your application, and, you know, we'll review it relative to the other candidates that we find.
If anyone has anything else to add, add, please….
Mel Yencken
Mel Yencken
27:06
I'll just say that, you know, at associate level, people might not have had the opportunity to, like, work on large products, which is fine, but
Or, like, we are seeing candidates who just built their own app and launched it on the App Store, or built a tool that was used for their project team, and they had real people on it, and, you know, they had a cycle of seeing how they used it, getting their feedback, iterating, seeing what usage actually happened, being able to demonstrate, like, some impact that it had. And that's such an important part of this role, is being able to show
how you design for a user, you ship to them, you see what happens, you improve, you iterate, and, like, you can do that full cycle. So, we definitely want to see how someone's done that, even if it's, like, you built a tool for your school, but someone… where you've had that cycle, so you can think creatively about
You know, how you could have something that's actually live.
Melanie Coissard
Melanie Coissard
28:02
Awesome. Thank you both for answering this question. We're also seeing a lot of question around technical skills. I think this is probably one of the newest requirement or newer things that might pop up in this program. So, what are the technical skills required, or that we would expect an APB to have?
Nitin Julka
Nitin Julka
28:28
So…
This is not a software engineering role, so we're not expecting, like, full software, you know, back-end software engineers, but it is…
a role that is expected to be very fluent with AI, AI tools, AI competency, to have deep technical understanding, and
An IDE should not scare you. Like, you should be able to work,
in, you know, I would almost think of it as, like, you're an entrepreneur, you are a founder, you are a builder, and you have to learn and do whatever it takes to build a great, delightful product, and take it to market and drive impact. And so, if you have to learn enough front-end code to do that, you have to make technical trade-offs, you have to do your prototype, you have to get your research.
You have to have the design craft, you have to bring in the right people, and lead, and drive that impact, and actually
bring your product into a market and get real-world impact and usage, that's not… like, the mindset is not, like, checking a box for, you know, for technical, or checking a box for design, or PM, or business. It's… it's really that
holistic builder mentality that I will do what it takes to bring my vision into the world and deliver real impact in the world.
So I would say it's more about that mentality and technical understanding.
But it's not, it's not a, you know, a back-end engineering role.
Melanie Coissard
Melanie Coissard
30:06
Exciting. Going further into that line of question, we're seeing a lot of questions around
tooling, AI tooling, so both in terms of the tools we're looking for in the application, are we talking about tools for brainstorming, ideation, or tools to actually develop, and then once actually in the role,
what are the tools that we are using, at LinkedIn, and that we will be provided the APBs with?
Mel, I feel like this is a great question for you.
Mel Yencken
Mel Yencken
30:39
Yeah, I mean, every AI tooling workstream right now. So, if you all, you know, people who are applying for this role, you should be trying all the tools, you know, there's free accounts for most of them, and you'll be seeing how they're changing, like, week on week, right? And so, with a large organization, traditionally.
it can take almost a year to provision a tool, but where LinkedIn is really innovating is moving super fast. We're actually partnering with quite a few different AI tools to run really early pilots, because we really believe that these tools are going to enable a single person to take an idea all the way through to shipping. That's the full-stack Builder vision.
So we're currently running pilots with ChatGPT Enterprise, we're running pilots, we have Figma Make already with, like, a lot of our design Olga on. We're running pilots with two other design tools for a subframe and magic patterns.
We have, pilots for Cursor, Windsurf AI,
we… so we, like, we have, across all functions, this investment right now to get the AI tooling in place, and we're testing and, like, prioritizing a lot of time being spent on those, and so we know by January that we'll have
these tools set up so that this cohort will be able to utilize them. I can't say exactly which ones it'll be. Obviously, we have Copilot as well, you know, being a part of Microsoft. But yeah, we're innovating on that, like, week on week right now.
Melanie Coissard
Melanie Coissard
32:09
Amazing, thank you. There was a fun question that I think it would be also interesting for this team to answer.
For the PMs or the designers in this meeting, how have our roles transformed with the rise of AI, already at our time at LinkedIn? And I can also kick us off with an answer here as an IC individual contributor at LinkedIn. I think it's been…
testing a lot of things, and today we are testing an agent that does a first trust and legal review for me, so instead of spending hours discussing with our legal team, I can really understand legal speak first, and go to them with, like, hey, I think this is a problem, or this will work. I've also tried to use Figma Make, which is a tool we're also piloting.
to describe to my engineer a small change that I wanted to make without having to bother my design partner that was really focused on a vision and a roadmap. So I was able to get those done so much quickly. And then overall, I've been using a lot of
ChatGPT to help me understand gaps in my thinking as well. It's been a great thought partner, in terms of, hey, here's a first vision, that I have,
put yourself in the shoes of a VP, like, are you getting what you're expecting, or do you feel like my thinking has some gaps? So it's really…
made me reshape all my PM workflows, and really, like, having this thought partner to help me get to a really good artifact much faster.
Anyone else want to answer this?
Praveen Gujar
Praveen Gujar
33:53
Yeah, I think I can chime in here. Just to follow up. I think one of the changes that we are seeing within LinkedIn also is to lead with a demo when you're in a key exec meeting or a strategic review.
I think that's something that, I have been seeing quite a bit, including me and my team, too, is when you go to a review, start with a demo, that is a prototype that you have built with either by yourself.
Or with a small group of individuals,
is a great way to demonstrate that, and to, tell the story at the pain point of the user, that in a very visual format, that resonates with the audience in the, in the meeting. And to an earlier question as well, like, every part of product lifecycle that I'm part of has been accelerated because of,
Working on, working with the AI tools in various manners, be it basically in brainstorming, or churning out one-pagers, has been a lot more effective than ever before.
Finally, I think on a personal front too, like, working on side projects,
that used to be far more laborious in the past has been much quicker and faster than ever before. I think it streamlines on the personal front quite a bit. The day-to-day chores you do, or even if you're basically interested in stock trading, like, how do you build an application to customize for yourself?
Has been, a revolutionary, thing for me as well, so….
Mel Yencken
Mel Yencken
35:32
I love that a little bit more. So, like, from a design perspective, we're seeing designers stepping into the role of PM.
Like, literally jumping in, writing product specs, doing analysis, and then on the other end, we also have a pilot for designers who are actually shipping code all the way through using AI tooling, so looking at
things that might have been hard for us to prioritize in the experience, where we've had this kind of backlog of, oh, this bug has been frustrating us, and then instead a designer can just jump in and actually ship that. And we already have that up and running. So, it's already changing the role pretty fundamentally. I think even my role, I spent at least
50% of my day now focused on full-stack builder efforts. Like, how can we actually think about this future of all of the organization's roles? So, it's no longer theoretical, it's really happening already.
